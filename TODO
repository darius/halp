We're still getting 'File "<string>", line 14' on syntax errors.
It looks like that message comes out of the SyntaxError exception
rather than the traceback. I tried setting value.filename = halp_filename
in get_lineno, but that did nothing. Come back to this.

tush variant

continuous halp mode: auto-rerun halp after every change to the buffer;
but don't show changed output after these auto-reruns (too disruptive);
instead just change the prefixes on outputs that change (to '#X ', say).

move cursor to position reported by compiler error message

use sys.meta_path:

more concise/useful Python error messages

doctest support -- mark an output as 'correct', and tell me when
there's an error

single-stepping of some sort

test isolation

allow multiline examples (and outputs?)

syntax coloring

support "literate python"? noweb?

for Haskell, handle compiler error messages for example lines

rewrite in elisp?

insert results asynchronously; don't hang up emacs

lisp support

persistent process to avoid startup time, if possible

make sure python isn't compiling pyhalp.py every time we run
