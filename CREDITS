The first version was written at a party in 2006 by Darius Bacon,
Brandon Moore, and Evan Murphy.

It was developed into something vaguely practical in 2008 by Darius.

Thanks to Nada Amin for getting it to work on Windows, Python 2.4, and Emacs 21.

Thanks to Richard Uhtenwoldt for making me add Emacs Lisp support and
pair-programming it with me.

For feedback, thanks to:
