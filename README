Haskell Active Literate Programming -- release 0.1

Runs specially marked lines from a literate Haskell file in the
context of the definitions in the file, and puts their output/result
underneath.

Any lines beginning with ") " are treated as input lines to ghci, with
the result, value, or interpreter error printed below on lines
beginning with "| ". Any existing output lines are overwritten. Python
doctest style functionality should be easy to build by using diff
instead.

To run it, type M-i in an emacs buffer. The buffer must compile
cleanly as literate Haskell and define the module Main.

To install it, put ghci-halp.sh wherever you like, edit the definition
of halp-helpers-directory in halp.el to refer to it, and set up your
.emacs to load halp.el. Something like this is nice for testing:

(defun rl ()
  (interactive)
  (load-file "halp.el"))

There's also a similar experiment with "literate shellscripts".
